# RecipeBook
# Overview

In this project, I have developed a recipe management system using the Kotlin programming language. The software allows users to add, search, delete, and display recipes. The recipes can then be saved to a file to allow for ongoing use. The primary focus of this project was to gain a practical understanding of the Kotlin language and its syntax. By implementing essential features such as user input handling, data manipulation, and file management, I aimed to solidify my understanding of the fundamental concepts in Kotlin.

Here is a short demonstration video. It includes a code walkthrough as well as a demo of the software running.
